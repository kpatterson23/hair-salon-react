# Beaut√© Artistique Salon

## Why I Built This Project

I built this project as a portfolio project to showcase my newly acquired skills as a React developer after finishing the React course at Nucamp (a web development bootcamp).

## Why a Hair Salon

My wife is an aspiring cosmotologist and dreams of one day owning a salon of her own. Though she is amazing at hair, the same isn't true about technology but she's luck I'm around! I built this hair salon website in honor of commitment to her craft and to demonstrate that I could build an entire website on my own. 

### What I wish I would have done better

Given that my bootcamp was moving fairly quickly and I was also working fulltime during development, I didn't have as much time as I would have hoped to work on the website. I wish I had more time to full flesh-out a better appointment calendar, maybe get some professional pictures added, and even learn how to implement a secure store where clients could pay for their service online if they so chose.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
